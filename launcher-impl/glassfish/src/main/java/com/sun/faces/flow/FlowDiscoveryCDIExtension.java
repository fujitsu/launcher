/*
 *  This is the hook into the bootstrapping of the entire feature.  
 *
 *  Use the CDI anntation scanning feature to find all beans annotated
 *  with @FlowDefinition.  The scanning work done here is leveraged
 *  in FlowDiscoveryCDIHelper.discoverFlows().
 *
 *  Use BeforeBeanDiscovery to manually register an application scoped
 *  bean FlowDiscoveryCDIHelper.  I would rather not do this, but I
 *  couldn't get the system to find this bean in any other way.  I think
 *  this may have something to do with CDI being told not to scan within
 *  javax.faces.jar, or something like that.
 *
 *  Use AfterBeanDiscovery to add a custom Context.  This is necessary
 *  because it was the only way I found that actually worked that let me
 *  pass in the results of the scanning into something I could invoke in
 *  when processing the JSF PostConstructApplicationEvent.
 *
 *  Use ProcessBean to build up a tuple for each bean annotated with
 *  @FlowDefinition { definingClass, flow-id, defining-document-id }.  A
 *  data structure containing all the tuples is passed to
 *  FlowDiscoveryCDIContext.
